# I can play Rock Paper Scissors  
This is a Rock Paper Scissors game application that uses a webcam to predict the player's move using a trained EfficientNet_B0 model.  
The application has a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter and uses PyTorch for model inference.   

## Features

Real-Time Prediction: Captures the player's hand gesture via webcam and predicts whether it is Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

*GUI Interface*: A clean  interface with:

*Live camera feed.

*Labels for player prediction, score tracking, and bot's choice.

*A "Predict" button to capture and evaluate gestures.

*AI Bot*: Generates a random choice (rock, paper, scissors) to play against the user.

*Score Tracker*: Tracks the player's score versus the bot.

*Model Integration*: EfficientNet_B0 for hand gesture classification.
